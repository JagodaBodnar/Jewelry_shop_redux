### Project description

Application has been based on previous [jewelry_shop project](https://github.com/JagodaBodnar/Jewelry-shop). Project has been refactored however to use ### Redux as source of state. It allowed me to see in a real life project the benefits and disadvantages of such approach.

Product images has been downloaded from [pngguru](https://www.pngguru.com/) according to licese notification on the website no attribution is required for Non-Commercial-Use.<br />
Home page images has been acquired as part of a free offert from [ADOBE STOCK](https://stock.adobe.com/).<br />
Cart paypal feature requires APIkey from [PayPalSandbox](https://developer.paypal.com/), which means that own key has to be obtained in order to use it.<br />
Products content is managed through [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).<br />
